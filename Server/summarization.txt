ion, Expressiveness and  Excess or Unnecessary Information.
 These qualities are rated  on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being the least and 5 being the most.
  The mean and standard deviation observed over these qualities  is depicted in the table.
 The results suggest that information  content is good in our summaries generated.
 But some people  are of the opinion that there is a lot of unrelated information,  and the standard deviation varies a lot.
 Also we need to  improve upon the abstractness quality, as most of the frames  are just a short hand representation of sentences in document  and hence turn out to be factual.

 C ONCLUSION   Summarization is an important field of research these days  and finds applications in the fields of information retrieval  like in news mining [17] and customer review mining [18] and  educational systems like intelligent tutors [19], question  generation systems [20].
 Many different approaches have  seem to work well on different types of text, like factual,  scientific papers, or news.
 Our system seems to perform well  on factual data.
 Further modifications could be improving the  feature space for centroid selection, better sentence generation  capabilities, or improved metric for semantic similarities.
 Also  a lot number of heuristics can be applied to preprocess the  document and improve the quality of information in the  primary stages.
 Our system needs improvement in sentence  generation and semantic role labelling.
 This work has been  done in the motivation to produce better quality and  meaningful summaries, which has been exemplified by our  results.
